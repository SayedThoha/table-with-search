# Angular User Filter Table

This Angular application displays a list of users in a table format and allows real-time filtering based on:

- **Name**
- **City**
- **Company Name**

The filtering is achieved using a custom Angular pipe (`filterPipe`) that performs a case-insensitive search across the user data.

## 🔍 Features

- Dynamic filtering as you type

- Responsive table layout
- Two-way binding using `ngModel`
